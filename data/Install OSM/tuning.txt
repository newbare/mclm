A service strategy is the method in which output is served to the client. This is a balance between proper form (being absolutely sure of reporting errors with the proper OGC codes, etc) and speed (serving output as quickly as possible). This is a decision to be made based on the function that GeoServer is providing. You can configure the service strategy by modifying the web.xml file of your GeoServer instance.

The possible strategies are:
Strategy 	Description
SPEED 	Serves output right away. This is the fastest strategy, but proper OGC errors are usually omitted.
BUFFER 	Stores the whole result in memory, and then serves it after the output is complete. This ensures proper OGC error reporting, but delays the response quite a bit and can exhaust memory if the response is large.
FILE 	Similar to BUFFER, but stores the whole result in a file instead of in memory. Slower than BUFFER, but ensures there won’t be memory issues.
PARTIAL-BUFFER 	A balance between BUFFER and SPEED, this strategy tries to buffer in memory a few KB of response, then serves the full output.
